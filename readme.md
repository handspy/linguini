# Linguini - Java Library for Linguistic Analysis

Linguini is a small Java library to perform Linguistic Analysis in written texts. It aims to be independent of the
natural language used, but will firstly focus on the portuguese (Portugal) language.

The portuguese replacements and toponyms were mostly copied from [NLPPORT](https://github.com/rikarudo/NLPPORT), hence those 
files are licensed under GNU GPLv3.

## Features

The project by default comes with a useful series of features:

- a simple text analysis providing an overall summary of stats from the text
- a lexical diversity analysis, which can use either MTLD or HD-D
- an emotional analysis based on an annotated dictionary for [JSpell](https://natura.di.uminho.pt/wiki/doku.php?id=ferramentas:jspell)

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

### Building the docs

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be
generated by using the following Maven command:

```
$ mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

It is a Java library, meant to be included as a dependency on any project which may want to make use of it.

### Prerequisites

The project has been tested on the following Java versions:
* JDK 8
* [JSpell](https://natura.di.uminho.pt/wiki/doku.php?id=ferramentas:jspell)

All other dependencies are handled through Maven, and noted in the included POM file.

### Installing

The recommended way to install the project is by setting it up as a dependency. To get the configuration information 
for this check the [Bintray repository][bintray-repo], or the [Maven Central Repository][maven-repo].

It is always possible to install it by using the usual Maven command:

```
$ mvn install
```

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:
